        bowler NFT… Which you can purchase in a loot box for just a dollar!

        Except for the fact that both of them are playable cricket NFTs that
        enable you to play metaverse cricket and win real cash prizes, there is
        no other similarity between the two!

        The genesis collection will not in any way be affected by the $1 NFT
        collection. Both of them enable you play different versions of MCL and
        they will be governed by different reward mechanisms altogether.
